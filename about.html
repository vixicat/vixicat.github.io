    <!-- hello, my name is rox
    
    i work on a variety of things but i primarily produce mediocre content in the midst of a lot of things i have interests in
    between things such as photography, design, and creative writing all the way to programming and coding projects
    i also am a relentess game addict and grinder in which i compete in multiple games, primarily being rocket league and destiny 2 worlds first raiding
    while i have seen success and i know plenty of people are jealous or envious of my skill, a lot of it has come at the cost of sanity and my life
    i attend school at oregon state university (pursuing computer science with an applied interest in simulation and game programming) and in a relationship at the moment-->
